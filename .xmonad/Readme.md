# MiddleColumn (4k / Large monitor friendly)

Having a large monitor means each time I'd open a new window in XMonad, it' go to the topleft. Not ideal.

This creates a single main window with two side columns. The two side columns have the windows vertically stacked.

It's similar to https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.13/docs/XMonad-Layout-ThreeColumns.html but it does not "collapse" the columns if there is less then 3 windows.
